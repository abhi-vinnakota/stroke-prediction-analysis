# Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Goal
The goal of this project was to analyze stroke patient data and predict whether or not an arbitrary patient would have a stroke. To achieve this, I trained ML models outlined in the Jupyter Notebook which predicted which factors were most impactful on whether or not a patient has stroke history. Please read the notebook in full if you are interested in my analysis and process. 

## Future Plans
Since many such analyses likely exist on Kaggle, and other places, I would like to make this project more unique. Perhaps it would be cool to have some type of front-end visualizations which features the insights I made. Also, I would like to build an API which fetches data from WHO or CDC and run this model on that data. This would make this project a lot more practical/impactful.
